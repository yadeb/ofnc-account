I have bank statement I want to analyse the income so I Iknow how much each payee has paid in the year. This information about payee is in the "Transaction DEscription" field
Transaction DEscription Can vary depending on the type of income 


The Full transaction description for each payment is separated by spaces
The name is at least the first two words but can be longer in FPI and SO income transaction types
In FPI after the name comes the reference which is a maximum of 18 characters it can include spaces, numbers, alhabets and special characters 
If it is FPI the last five words is the transaction details like date, time and some IDS
If it is SO you don't get the transaction details just a transaction description
If it is a check deposit you only get an ID which is a number
The transaction description field doesn't have information about what type of income it is, I can only guess/know by the number of words in the field

Create a python function that takes the a dataframe that containes table with transaction description and amount fields. 
From this dataframe extract the name into a new column

import pandas as pd

def extract_payee_name(df):
    def get_name(desc):
        words = desc.split()
        n = len(words)
        # Heuristic: FPI has at least 8 words (name + reference + 5 details)
        if n >= 8:
            # Assume last 5 words are transaction details, reference is before that (max 18 chars)
            main = words[:-5]
            # Try to find the reference (max 18 chars, can be multiple words)
            # We'll assume the reference is the last word before the 5 details if it's <= 18 chars
            # Name is everything before the reference
            for i in range(len(main)-1, 1, -1):
                ref_candidate = ' '.join(main[i:])
                if len(ref_candidate) <= 18:
                    return ' '.join(main[:i])
            return ' '.join(main)
        # Heuristic: Check deposit is "Check Deposit" + ID (2 words)
        elif n == 2 and words[0].lower() == "check" and words[1].isdigit():
            return "Check Deposit"
        # Heuristic: SO or other, name is at least first two words
        else:
            return ' '.join(words[:2]) if n >= 2 else desc
    df['Name'] = df['Transaction Description'].apply(get_name)
    return df
